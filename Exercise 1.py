# Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers

#Given 1

number1 = 20
number2 = 30

multi = number1 * number2
add = number1 + number2

if multi <= 1000:
    print("The result is " + str(multi))
else:
    print("The result is " + str(add))

#Given 2

number1 = 40
number2 = 30

multi = number1 * number2
add = number1 + number2

if multi <= 1000:
    print("The result is " + str(multi))
else:
    print("The result is " + str(add))
